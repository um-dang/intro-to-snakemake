# Intro to snakemake

This repository contains a couple of examples which are useful for learning about snakemake

Examples:
* [Toy example](toy_example/)
* [Bioinformatics example - RNASeq](human_chr22)


<details><summary>Expand - Why use snakemake?</summary>

We hope these examples will provide enough starting material to get started using snakemake, and to demonstrate the following features which make it incredibly useful for creating reproducible workflows:
* make-like framework **in python**
* Built-in environment management compatibility (conda, singularity)
* Flexible dispatch of pipeline steps allows portability across compute environments (laptop, cluster, cloud)
