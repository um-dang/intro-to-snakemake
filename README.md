# Intro to snakemake

## `git clone https://github.com/um-dang/intro-to-snakemake`


This repository contains some examples which can be useful exercises when learning snakemake, covering the core functionality and a few of its salient features.

Examples:
1. [Toy example](toy_example/)
2. [Bioinformatics example - RNASeq](human_chr22)


<details><summary>Expand - Why use snakemake?</summary>

We hope these examples will provide enough starting material to get started using snakemake, and to demonstrate the following features which make it incredibly useful for creating reproducible workflows:
* make-like framework **in python**
* Built-in environment management compatibility (conda, singularity)
* Flexible dispatch of pipeline steps allows portability across compute environments (laptop, cluster, cloud)
